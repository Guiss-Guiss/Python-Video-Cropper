The provided code creates a graphical interface to crop video files.
It utilizes Python libraries like OpenCV for video processing and tkinter for GUI elements.
Users select an input video file and specify an output file for the cropped result.
The interface lets users preview frames and select one for cropping using a slider.
Upon clicking "Select," a window allows users to define a crop area while maintaining a chosen aspect ratio.
The selected frame, crop dimensions, and total frames are used to display a progress bar during cropping.
The cropped video, with preserved audio, is then generated.
