Video Cropper is a Python script that allows you to crop a video. mp4 files are supported. Audio is also supported.
The script uses OpenCV to read the video, tkinter for the GUI, Pillow to convert the photo to PhotoImage object
and MoviePy to add audio to the cropped video. The script allows you to select the crop area by drawing a rectangle on the video.
You can also select the aspect ratio of the crop area.
